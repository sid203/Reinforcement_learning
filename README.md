REINFORCEMENT LEARNING : 

DESCRIPTION OF FILES:

1. RL_Frozenlake_Cliffwalker.ipynb : Jupyter notebook with the code for Q-Learning ( off policy TD 					learning ). The program runs two board games namely Frozen lake 				and Cliff walker. Environment simulation for Frozen lake has been 					imported from python library 'gym' while for cliff walker the 					environment dynamics and simulation has been written down in the 					notebook. Q-learning algorithm uses epsilon-greedy policy to 					search through the state space to find maximizing actions.
